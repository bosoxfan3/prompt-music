Generate Spotify playlists based on a custom mood or scenario using AI and the Spotify API.

## üöÄ Live Demo

## üß† How It Works

Users enter a prompt (like "studying during a thunderstorm"), and the app uses OpenAI to generate relevant song recommendations, then pulls matching tracks using the Spotify API. If a user authorizes the app to access their Spotify, they can also save a playlist to their account!
